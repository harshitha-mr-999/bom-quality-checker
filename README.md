# bom-quality-checker

This app streamlines the validation of Bill of Materials (BOM) data by automatically checking for missing, duplicate, or invalid entries. Built with Python and Streamlit, it allows users to upload BOM files and instantly highlights issues such as:

1)Missing or blank fields (e.g., Manufacturer number, Item text).

2) Duplicate part numbers or subject numbers.

Easy-to-read reports showing whether the BOM passes quality checks

Advantages of the Project: 

1) Manual BOM validation is time consuming hence this project helps to automatically detect the missing manufacture number , duplication etc.
2) This project saves the Engineer and Sale team's lot of repetative work
3) User Friendly : Even a non-technical person can upload the excel and see result without coding
4) Easy visualization
5) Scalability : Can handle both small and large BOM data .
